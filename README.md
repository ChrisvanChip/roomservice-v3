# Roomservice

Simple hobby project to create a React Native app which connects two phones, where one is the caller and the other is the server. When the caller presses the bell, it will ring the phone of the server.

This is the third iteration, now actually a mobile app. I'm comfortable with web dev, but this is my first native app. Glad React Native exists tho, it has less of a learning curve than Java/Kotlin :p

Inspired to make this when a family member was recovering and I was working in another room - with music of course, so I couldn't always hear shouting.
